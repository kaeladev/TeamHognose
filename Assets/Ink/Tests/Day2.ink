this goes there... #inky

whatever that means uh... #inky
* uh, Hello Inky ?
- WAHH!! Sorry I got scared, I was very focused in my paperwork. How is it going? #inky
* Better than you it appears, I'm not too good with paperwork...
- Heh, me neither, but we have to do what we have to do to comply with the local laws. #inky
It's the thing we do right... To keep this beautiful bakery operating. #inky
Do you like working there so far? #inky
* I like working at the bakery. ->bakerylove
* I expected to do bakery things but this work is quite different from what I expected... ->bakeryplush
* My dream is to become a baker, not a plushie-scratcher. When the internship is over, I will probably find one in a more realistic bakery. ->realbakery

== bakerylove ==
Nice, nice. #inky 
I figured you enjoyed your time here! #inky
I mean it's not so bad: the shop smells good, the workers are nice, labour conditions are alright... #inky
I wish we were doing more recipes. #inky
But, you know, learning new recipes take time and skills we probably lack of... #inky
So we do our best to become cinnamon rolls experts at least! #inky
-> inky2

== bakeryplush ==
Ah, right haha. #inky
I must say that this was not what I expected either when I got in this bakery... #inky
I really love eating snacks and I figured this was a great place to learn new recipes. #inky
Unfortunately, my coworkers... fall in the lazy side of the coworkers spectrum I guess... #inky
So at the end of the day, I feel like I'm doing most of the things we need to do to keep this sweet business running. #inky
I'm not complaining though: at least I know the work is done is qualitative. #inky
And I like the slimy texture of the dough... Feels kind of nice under the tentacles... #inky
-> inky2

== realbakery ==
I mean, I get you. #inky
Being a plushie scratcher sounds like a nice activity though. #inky
Labour is tough in general. #inky
I guess many people would give a lot to work at such a position, where the air smells like vanilla and the most we ask from you is to tickle plushies awake... #inky
Have you ever actually worked or..? #inky
You know this is cozier than actual labour right? #inky
-> inky2

== inky2 ==
* You must be proud of your shop!
- Ah ah, unfortunately it's not my shop. #inky
* What do you mean? Aren't you the boss around here??
- Alas no, I'm just a normal worker.
We do have a CEO though. We don't see him much.
Kind of evil in my opinion but... I mean... CEO life must be hard right..?
*Are you sure though?
- I mean, we are the ones working all day, tentacles in the batter, trying to keep things running and cash flowing in...
But there must be some difficulty in being CEO right?
* ...
- Right??
Anyway, haha. I might become manager someday, who knows?
At least there's that.
If I work hard, comply, put a lot of efforts into it and keep smiling, I guess I could become at least a store manager or something.
That could be nice. I would add new items on the menu. Change the decoration a little bit.
* I wish you the best in pursuing your dream career.
- That's very nice of you. Thank you for that. Once I'm manager, who knows, I might promote you to happiness-and-store-running co-lead or something, haha.
* Thank you Inky, see you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow, fresh as a daisy!
